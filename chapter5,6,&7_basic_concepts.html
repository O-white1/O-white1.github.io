    <p>"Hi I am Muffins, I wsa adopted by my family when I was just three weeks old."</p>
    <p>"My new mom is a human, they are funny creatures."</p>
    <p>I left the pet store with my nre mom and my new sister, Maria.
          They took me straight to the pet store to by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A kitty baby bottle, with formula</li>
        <li>A small cloth toy</li>
        <li>A litter box with litter</li>
        <li>Food (for later)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle because I was so young.</p>
