            <p class="text">I am Owen White, A 14 year old highschool freshman at J.A. Craig Highschool Janesville WI,
                who has taken an academic interest in both music and 
                computer science.  In music, I am an intermediate level piano student, having been taking private lessons for nearly 4 years now.

            </p>
            <p class="text">In computer science, I am currently going through the majority of the computer science classes here at my school.
                These classes are giving me valuable experience with coding languages like JavaScript, Python, and C# as well as making me think critically in a problem solving setting.

            </p>
            <p class="text">At my school I also participate in some clubs.  My favorite of which being Chess Club, because I have always enjoyed playing the game with friends and family.</p>
