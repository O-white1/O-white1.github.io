        <p class="progtext">As a freshman in highschool I have been introduced to many new topics, 
            a way that someone like myself engages in those new concepts is by making larger
            scale projects that ever before in my academic carer.</p>
            <br/>
        <p class="progtext">One of those projects is this very website.  Having made the entire thing from the ground up using
            HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.  In my time at highschool thus far I have learned a lot; the skills in 
            my Web Design class that I have learned have been both fascinating and fun.
        </p>
        <p class="progtext">
            Web Design has not been my only endeavor into Computer Science however.  I have also been
            in both a Game Design class and a Computer Programming class this semester.  In my Game Design
            class I have learned the fundamentals of the Godot 4 game engine as well as the steps that are taken in making a game.
            My main project for that class was a top down 2D dungeon crawler game.  Unfortunately some mishaps occurred which rendered
            all of the work that went into it essentially for naught.  Nonetheless that project as well as the class in which i was making it, were immensely enjoyable.

        </p>
        <p class="progtext">My final computer science class is Computer Programming, wherein I have learned the fundamentals of the Python programming language.
            My main Project in this class was to make a Whack-A-Mole like game through a software called Sharp Develop, using Python.
            I actually found this to be the most fun project of the three; the things I learned in the class made the experience an absolute blast that I enjoyed every day.
            In making my Whack-A-Mole game, I learned a lot about using math and functions to produce a cohesive experience through what I now consider such simple concepts.
